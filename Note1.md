# Notes for 1st lesson

## Programming skill
| Time          | Language      | pros           | 
| ------------- |:-------------:| --------------:|
| Week1-5       | Linus (bash)  | string process |
| Week6-16      | R             | data matrix    |

## Bioinformation&Genomics
### 1. Gene:
   * A segment fo information, can be DNA or RNA or other kinds of things
### 2. Human genome:
   * about 3Gb but only 2w genes
   * most are "junk DNA"
   * However, it appears to be that 75% of human genome can be transcripted
   * But only 2-3% can be translated into proteins
### 3. Genes:
   * coding and noncoding genes
### 4. RNAs:
   * the timeline for RNA discovery
   * mRNA -> tRNA/rRNA -> mi-RNA -> LincRNAs
### 5. The main feature for bioinformatics discovery
   * from DATA to CONCLUSION
   * especially big&high dimensional data
